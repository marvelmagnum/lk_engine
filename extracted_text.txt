You stir into consciousness.  Heat and blazing sunlight... 
the slow rumble of a wagon... heavy chains upon your 
limbs.  You groan, your mouth dry, your stomach empty.  
As your eyes focus you can see your companions, fellow 
survivors of the brutal pirate attack, crushed together 
with you upon the floor of a rolling wagon.  You 
remember little since then, except vowing to your new-
found friends that you would stick together, come what 
may.  You are relieved to see that they are still alive, but

If you win, turn to 478.  You can flee at the start of 
your round if you wish.  If you do, the orcs will chase 
you out of the dungeon.  Turn to 515.

The treasure chest contains 200 silver coins and a 
bluestone.  Take what you wish, and then record the 
code A45.  Not wishing to tarry longer, you depart the 
chamber and return to the crossroads.  Turn to 46.
