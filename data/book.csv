Legendary Kingdoms - The Valley Of Bones
1,"You stir into consciousness.  Heat and blazing sunlight... 
the slow rumble of a wagon... heavy chains upon your 
limbs.  You groan, your mouth dry, your stomach empty.  
As your eyes focus you can see your companions, fellow 
survivors of the brutal pirate attack, crushed together 
with you upon the floor of a rolling wagon.  You 
remember little since then, except vowing to your new-
found friends that you would stick together, come what 
may.  You are relieved to see that they are still alive, but 
where are you?
	
Gazing through the bars of the wagon, your eyes 
focus on a blazing yellow-grey desert.  To your left, filling 
the sky, are the Stonewalls – a massive and impenetrable 
mountain range that divides the barbarian kingdoms 
of the south from the antique and mysterious lands of 
Drakehallow.  But which side of the range are you? 
The answer becomes immediately apparent as you look 
beyond the smelly dragonyaks which are ponderously 
hauling your cage.  A vast, crumbling city of minarets 
and run-down adobe buildings fills your view.  The sting 
in the air and on your lips tells you all you need to know. 
This is Saltdad, cruel throne of the tyrant Iron King, one 
of half a dozen tin-pot dictators in the barbaric Valley 
of Bones.  You are far from civilised lands here…
	
Thin-faced slavers with spears rattle the sides of your 
cage, barking at you to get down.  You slump on your 
hindquarters.  For the moment there is nothing you can 
do with you and your companions in chains.  You swear 
you will regain your freedom and start your lives anew. 
But first, you must survive the horrors of slavery.

throws an arm around your neck.
	
“Is it my prinsh charming?” she slurs, nuzzling into 
your chest.
	
“Well... if by prince you meant castle pot-washer, 
then yes,” you smile, carrying her over to her quarters 
in the palace.
	
“Tell me something,” says Amelia dreamily, between 
snoozes, as you bear her through the palace.  “Why are 
you so charming to everyone except me?”
	
“Charming is another word for lying,” you say in a 
rare moment of honesty.  “I’d never lie to you, Amelia…”
	
Her snores cut off a potentially romantic moment.

who is already loading supplies onto the mules.  She is 
joined by three other young scholars who look fresh out 
of university.  They don’t look the type who could handle 
themselves in a dangerous jungle.
	
“We’ll follow our established route into the jungle, 
and then branch off south once we reach the checkpoint,” 
says Emlyn.  “We’ve discovered all sorts of interesting 
plants, but so far surprisingly little that is edible.”	
“What kind of dangers will we face?” you ask.
	
“Most of the jungle beasts leave us alone... to be 
honest, the monkeys are the most dangerous things 
you’ll find.  They travel in huge packs.  They’re intelligent, 
thieving sorts.  You should watch out for them.”

locations:  Chalice, Clifftop, Cursus, Lhasbreath, 
Luutanesh or Saltdad.  If you go to these places, 
Skullcracker will wait outside until you leave.  Ogres aren’t 
very popular in civilised places.	
• Even though he can’t stay in human inns, Skullcracker
will recover Health points at the same rate as your other 
party members when you pay to stay at an inn.	
• He won’t board a ship.  He had a queasy tummy
on the orc boat and won’t tolerate going aboard another.  
If you insist on going sailing, he will leave the party.	
• His contract with you ends when you travel to
another land – i.e. you begin to explore another book.

hundreds of soldiers clashing on the field of battle.  
Each unit represents around five hundred soldiers.  In 
any given battle you can bring a maximum of six units 
from your barracks.  It will probably help if you record 
the location of your units, and those of your enemy, on 
the Battlefield section on your adventure sheet.
	
To win a Mass Combat you must control two out of 
three combat zones.  The zones are called Left Flank, 
Centre and Right Flank.  You control a zone when you 
have units in it, but your opponent does not.  As soon 
as either you or the enemy general controls two zones 
the battle immediately ends.  Any enemy units in the 
remaining zone will rout and flee as soon as it becomes 
obvious that one side has won.
	
Units have two attributes – Strength and Morale. 
Strength shows how good the unit is at fighting, and 
Morale demonstrates how well a unit can cope with 
upsets such as casualties and enemy magic.
	
Before the battle you must arrange your units on 
the battlefield.  You can put a maximum of two units 
into each zone (Left Flank, Centre and Right Flank).  
One unit is put at the Front – preferably a unit with a 
high Strength score – and the second unit is put behind 
in Support.  The Support unit is there to take over the 
fight if the unit at the Front routs (runs away!).  You 
can see where the enemy have deployed their units, so 
try to match or beat the Strength score of the enemy 
unit at the Front in each zone.
	
Once you have assigned your units the battle will 
begin.  You will fight in each zone, starting in the Left 
Flank, moving to the Centre, and then fighting on the 
Right Flank.  If you have any spellcasters who can cast 
Mass Combat spells, each caster can cast a single spell 
just before the combat starts.  If you have any spells 
left over, you can cast again each time you are about 
to fight on the Left Flank.
	
Starting with the enemy unit at the Front on the 
Left Flank, roll a die and add that unit’s Strength score 
to the result.  This is the unit’s battle score.  Now do 
the same for your own unit at the front.  If your battle 
score is higher than the enemy’s, the enemy must make 
a morale check.  If the enemy’s score is higher, you must 
make a morale check.  If the results are equal the fight 
is inconclusive – move onto the next zone.
	
To make a morale check, roll a die and compare it to 
the defeated unit’s Morale score.  If the result is higher, 
that unit immediately routs.  Cross it off the battlefield!  
If the result is equal or lower than the unit’s Morale 
score the unit does not rout – but it does lose a point 
of Morale.  The more often a unit checks Morale, the 
lower its Morale becomes.
	
If a unit routs, the unit behind it in support can 
immediately take its place.  If there is no unit in 
support, then the zone is lost.  
	
Keep fighting, moving from zone to zone, until 
either you or your opponent controls two zones.  Units 
in Support do not fight until the unit at the Front has 
routed – at that point the unit in Support moves to the 
Front.  As soon someone controls two zones the battle 
is over.

You follow the soldier into the gorgeous palace, quite 
the equal of any manorial estate in Royce or Drakehallow. 
You are led into a private study where you meet Unbraaki 
himself.  He is an elegant, though rather short, man with 
a long, thin oiled moustache.  His robes are a dazzle of 
colours that seem to shift before your eyes.  On his desk 
sits a small monkey, oddly wearing a tiny wizard’s hat.  It 
looks at you with penetrating, intelligent eyes.  Unbraaki 
bids you to sit, seating himself on a throne-like chair 
cunningly designed to make him look taller.
	
“I am pleased you came to see me,” smiles Unbraaki. 
“I have been following your progress, and that of your 
queen, with great interest.  I am now satisfied that the 
wind is changing in the valley, and that the Everchild 
is both a promising and likely leader.”	
“You will support her, then?” you press.
	
“Perhaps,” says Unbraaki suddenly cold.  “My soldiers 
are some of the best in the land, and their loyalty comes 
with a cost.”	
“I’m sure the Everchild can provide you with the 
necessary compensation,” you say breezily.	
“The Everchild does not have what I want,” 
Unbraaki says.	
“And what do you want, eminence?” you ask.
	
Unbraaki rises and walks to a bookcase.  He snaps 
his fingers, and the monkey on the desk scales the tall 
shelves, pulling down an ancient tome and passing it to 
his master.  
Unbraaki opens the book at a particular page and shows 
you a picture.  It appears to be a triangular object, grey 
or black in colour, with light streaming through it.  “The 
black prism,” says Unbraaki.  “It holds the secrets of light 
itself.  Long I’ve sought it, in this world and the world 
of shadow, but to no avail.  I have consulted an oracle 
in Drakehallow who told me that only the agents of the 
queen of Saltdad can find the prism.  Of course, there 
has been no queen in Saltdad for a thousand years.  You 
have just made that happen.  I want you to find me the 
black prism, and in exchange I will provide my soldiers 
to the Everchild’s cause.”

If not, read on.	
“Where can I find it?” you ask.	
“I only know that it was hidden on the south coast of 
the valley,” says Unbraaki.  “Perhaps the patriarch has it 
hidden in his vault?  Or maybe it lies in the dread city 
of Mordain?  You are fated to find it, so I doubt you will 
struggle hard to locate it.”

it was called then.  She ruled us with wisdom and 
patience. When Abraxas, the demon lord, rose from his 
pit she led an army of warriors and immortals against 
him.  I was the only king to deny her call, as I foresaw 
combat against the beast of death was impossible.  I was 
sanctioned, but when the dust settled it was she and her 
fellow kings who were dead, and her threat to end my 
rule came to nothing.  Abraxas destroyed the valley,

before I risk the wrath of the patriarch of Cursus and 
side with her.”

“I am!” he hisses.  “And I was high priest of all your 
kind once.  When the demon lord came, we slithered 
from our underground dwellings from the cracks in the 
earth he smote with his sword.  We took pity on you, 
took you as our slaves from your ruined cities.  Gave you a 
home and pious work to perform, building temples in the 
name of Cursus.  So cunning you were!  Joined us in the 
worship of Cursus, your voices singing with ours... and 
then betrayal!  You stole our god for your own!  Escaped 
your chains and built your own temples without us.  Your 
monuments were so magnificent that Cursus abandoned 
us for your kind.”

in your monument-cluttered land!  No human hand wrote

Montague Pass-Bailey.  All the high lords in the county 
were there that night.  I remember Count Spenser patting 
me on the head for bringing him a cup of mead, and 
being spat on and cuffed by your father for accidentally 
brushing past him.”	
“Sorry about that…” you say guiltily.	
“Why?  You didn’t do it,” says Emlyn flatly.	
“I think I’m always apologising for him,” you add 
sheepishly.  “He’s... very traditional, I suppose.”
	
“It must have been tough growing up with Baron 
Baldwin Dayne as your father,” she sympathises.
	
“I didn’t grow up with him... I barely saw him,” you 
mutter.  “Fourteen years I lived in Fosterly Castle.  I spoke 
with him three times.  He was ashamed of me.  I don’t 
know what it was about me that was so different from 
other bastard-born.  Your father loves you and educated 
you as a scholar.  Montague now serves his father as a 
spymaster.  I scrubbed the castle floors and looked after 
the horses.  I was treated like a peasant... and he called 
me such dreadful names, and never my own.”	
“Well, you’re free of him now,” says Emlyn.	
You laugh. “You’re never free of your father.. not really.”	
Emlyn pauses, and then searches her bag for a pair of

He nods to you and takes you to the back of the inn, 
into a beautiful chamber of yellow silks and handsome 
blue tapestries.  Perched cross-legged on a cushion is 
the Everchild, no longer a ragged waif, but a beautiful 
golden-haired girl with piercing blue eyes, dressed in 
flowing robes of Chalice silk.
	
“My champions,” she smiles warmly.  “I had hoped 
you would come.  I presume that your presence here 
means that you are willing to assist me in my claims 
on the throne of Saltdad?  By now you will have seen 
the Iron King’s cruelty firsthand, and perhaps even 
encountered the savage zealotry of the true ruler of the 
valley, the patriarch of Cursus?  These vile men must be 
deposed if we are to have any hope of restoring justice 
and civilisation to the valley.”
	
The Everchild indicates a map of the Valley of 
Bones that lies spread out in front of her.  “First things 
first,” she says.  “Historically the Everchild has always 
ruled from Saltdad, so that is our first target.  To take 
Saltdad we must defeat the army of the Iron King in 
battle.  I have begun the process of raising my own 
army in secret, from amongst the downtrodden and 
oppressed in his kingdom.  Alas, I still have only half 
as many men as the king has.  I must have more if I 
am to be successful.  The cities of Chalice, and even 
Lhasbreath, might be willing to lend us aid if they 
could be convinced.  I would like you to speak with 
them on my behalf and ask them to send soldiers to 
aid my revolution.”
	
The Everchild clears her throat.  “Of course, I would 
not need as many troops if the forces of the Iron King 
were depleted.”  She clicks her fingers and Che Long 
steps forwards to present you with a small bottle.   
It is a <b>vial of poison</b>, the pale-yellow liquid promising 
death to any who drink it.  Take it, if you wish.
	
“The Bronzeguard are the elite force of the Iron 
King, wearing enchanted armour that makes them 
almost invulnerable in battle,” explains the Everchild. 
“In order to foster a sense of brotherhood, the 
Bronzeguard all live in a single barracks in the centre 
of Saltdad.  This leaves them vulnerable to... accidents.  
If they were to be removed from the king’s forces, I 
would need fewer reinforcements.”
	
“Lastly, all attempts on the Iron King’s life have 
failed thanks to the attentions of his golem bodyguard, 
Malronac the Deathengine,” says the Everchild.  “We 
believe he acquired this monstrosity from the ruins 
of the palace.  It has since acted as both his personal 
guard and a crude assassin of the Iron King’s enemies.  
The villain will often be found wandering the streets 
on some bloody errand.  If you can get him alone, and 
end him, our victory would be all the more likely.”

“I know this girl,” confirms King Scarrenden, 
glugging wine from a dragonyak horn.  “She called 
herself Milagros then.  About a year ago the treacherous 
forces of Cursus attempted to ambush and burn my city 
to the ground.  That young girl tried to warn me, but 
I had her enslaved and sent to work on the fields.  She 
held no malice, and in the aftermath of a bitter battle 
against the patriarch’s forces she saved my life with her 
healing magics.  As she tended me, she spoke of her 
vision of a united valley, free from the arbitrary tyranny 
of the desert kings.”
	
Scarrenden laughs and shakes his head.  “To my face, 
she called me a tyrant and an ogre.  Yet still... the girl’s 
vision was a powerful one.  I gave the girl her freedom 
for saving me, and yet it seemed too small a reward for 
such a virtuous act.  However... I cannot support her in 
this rebellion.  Her followers are ex-slaves and pacifists. 
Her gentleness does her credit, but it is force and iron 
that rules the valley.  I will not strip soldiers from my 
realm with Cursus at my back.”
	
“Much has changed since then,” you insist. “The 
Everchild’s army is growing.  Her followers include great 
warriors and strategists.  If you ally with her, you may 
present a united front against Cursus.  You do not have 
to fight alone anymore.”	
The king thinks for a few moments, addressing his 
councillors whilst you are presented with more drink.  
Eventually he rises, ready to make his judgement.  “If the 
Everchild has become so mighty,” he decrees, “she must 
prove it.  It is strength my people respect.  Bring me the

It has been several years since you have been home, and 
you cannot help but feel some nerves.  Your brother-in-
law Janu, the current head of the household, greets you 
curtly as you enter, but your sister and mother are more 
welcoming.
	
“Akihiro!” cries your mother in joy, scarcely managing 
an obligatory bow before wrapping you in her arms. 
“You have come home at last!”
	
“Don’t be silly, mother,” chides Yuko, your sister.  “He 
is still on his travels.”
	
“And shall stay on them,” growls Janu.  “You bring 
your dishonour with you, Akihiro.  I see you keep truck 
with foreigners now?  Is your hatred of your homeland 
so complete?”
	
“Is your rudeness?” snaps Yuko, gazing sharply at her 
husband.  “Come Akihiro, we shall speak outside.”
	
You cannot answer your brother-in-law for shame 
and allow yourself to be taken out of the house.  You sit 
upon an old bench by the riverside, your sister sitting by 
you.  “He is right to chide me so,” you admit.  “I should 
not have returned after my failure at the temple…”
	
“Not every man is suited to be a kensai,” says Yuko.  
“Why, even father and grandfather could not complete 
the training.”
	
“Yet, before that, there was a sword saint in every 
generation of our family,” you say.  “How thin our blood 
has become that even three generations is not enough to 
shake off our weakness!  That you must marry Janu, a 
common farmer, because our name has fallen into such 
dishonour.”
	
Yuko shakes her head.  “I married Janu because I love 
him, fool that I am.  And this dishonour is only in your 
head, and in the heads of idiots.  You are a fine man, 
Akihiro.  Find your own destiny.  Do not be shackled 
to the past.”
	
“That is to let the past beat me,” you say, grinding 
your teeth.  “No.  I shall return to the temple.  I shall 
complete my training.  And I shall return honour to our 
family’s name.  I swear it!”
	
You stand, and then bow to your sister.  “When you 
see me again, I shall be a different man.”
	
“Be safe!” urges your sister, as she watches you 
disappear across the rice paddies.

You speak with the Everchild about your adventures,

crumbling steps, before emerging from the tunnel out 
into the hillside.  A flash of green metal to your left 
alerts you to your quarry just in time, and you leap over 
rocks and fallen trees, Yu Yan getting closer and closer 
as you dash.  
	
You run along a small ledge, Yu Yan slowing 
somewhat to keep her footing, when suddenly you see 
something that makes you stop. The view from the 
hillside is glorious... the twinkling, silver river, the flood 
of a crimson sun colouring the beached blue vault a many-
hued purple. The arrangement of the hills, in a formation 
of eye-pleasing symmetry against the desert floor. It is as 
if you have stumbled upon a vision of nirvana.
