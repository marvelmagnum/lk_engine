You stir into consciousness.  Heat and blazing sunlight... the slow rumble of a wagon... heavy chains upon your limbs.  You groan, your mouth dry, your stomach empty.  As your eyes focus you can see your companions, fellow survivors of the brutal pirate attack, crushed together with you upon the floor of a rolling wagon.  You remember little since then, except vowing to your new-found friends that you would stick together, come what may.  You are relieved to see that they are still alive, but where are you?
Gazing through the bars of the wagon, your eyes focus on a blazing yellow-grey desert.  To your left, filling the sky, are the Stonewalls – a massive and impenetrable mountain range that divides the barbarian kingdoms of the south from the antique and mysterious lands of Drakehallow.  But which side of the range are you? The answer becomes immediately apparent as you look beyond the smelly dragonyaks which are ponderously hauling your cage.  A vast, crumbling city of minarets and run-down adobe buildings fills your view.  The sting in the air and on your lips tells you all you need to know. This is Saltdad, cruel throne of the tyrant Iron King, one of half a dozen tin-pot dictators in the barbaric Valley of Bones.  You are far from civilised lands here…
Thin-faced slavers with spears rattle the sides of your cage, barking at you to get down.  You slump on your hindquarters.  For the moment there is nothing you can do with you and your companions in chains.  You swear you will regain your freedom and start your lives anew. But first, you must survive the horrors of slavery.	Turn to <b>631.</b>

You swoop Amelia up into your arms just before she reaches the wine barrel.  She shrieks in delight and throws an arm around your neck.
“Is it my prinsh charming?” she slurs, nuzzling into your chest.
“Well... if by prince you meant castle pot-washer, then yes,” you smile, carrying her over to her quarters in the palace.
“Tell me something,” says Amelia dreamily, between snoozes, as you bear her through the palace.  “Why are you so charming to everyone except me?”
“Charming is another word for lying,” you say in a rare moment of honesty.  “I’d never lie to you, Amelia…”
Her snores cut off a potentially romantic moment. Tucking her into bed you go to join the rest of your companions.  Note in Amelia’s notes box that she has gained a heart for Brash. Brash also gains a heart for Amelia.	Now turn to <b>280.</b>

You meet up with the lead scholar, Emlyn Pass-Ross, who is already loading supplies onto the mules.  She is joined by three other young scholars who look fresh out of university.  They don’t look the type who could handle themselves in a dangerous jungle.
“We’ll follow our established route into the jungle, and then branch off south once we reach the checkpoint,” says Emlyn.  “We’ve discovered all sorts of interesting plants, but so far surprisingly little that is edible.”	“What kind of dangers will we face?” you ask.
“Most of the jungle beasts leave us alone... to be honest, the monkeys are the most dangerous things you’ll find.  They travel in huge packs.  They’re intelligent, thieving sorts.  You should watch out for them.”
Sir Lawrence emerges from his tent to kiss his daughter goodbye and to wish you luck.  Soon you have emerged from the wooden gates of Lhasbreath and are making your way towards the wall of trees that is the Lhasbreath jungle.  Within the canopy of the jungle it is hot and humid.  The ground is moist and seems to be the nest of thousands of tiny, biting insects.  It must have rained recently, for the path ahead is flooded.  Emlyn curses.  She intended to take that route through the jungle to reach the checkpoint.	Follow the flooded path anyway (turn to <b>609</b>)?

With a high kick you send the final monk sprawling.  The other monks in the temple lower their eyes and return to their duties, unwilling to block your progress further.  You retrieve your weapon and march smartly into the temple.
Honnu is waiting for you, cross-legged on the floor. You join him in meditation for an hour or so, your companions venturing elsewhere in the city now they can see you are safe.  “It is rare for a supplicant to be granted the trials of perfection twice, but you are an unusual man, Akihiro.  You must know that your father never returned from the trials.  But I sense in you a steel he never had.”	“Thank you, Honnu,” you say, bowing your head.
“There would be little point in having you study at the temple, you are already skilled in your craft,” shrugs Honnu.  “Instead I shall send you straight onto your tasks.  Two must be completed before you are deemed worthy.  It is traditional to send an applicant to retrieve some trifling artefact as proof of dedication; a tedious matter, since the only item of true worth is enlightenment.  Therefore, I bid you find me a silver idol.  Find yourself, Akihiro, whilst you are at it.”	“Where can I find a silver idol?” you ask unsurely.	“I’m sure more than one exists, but a man of open mind and willing to embrace his destiny might find one in the caves of Uranu,” suggests Honnu.  “That place has tested, and slain, many a kensai aspirant.  Go wisely, Akihiro.  I shall see you soon.”

“You should send the man to the Church of Cursus and have priests ritually scar him,” says Ti’quon coldly.  “That way he shall be both punished and spiritually improved.”
“Yes!” hisses the king.  “The scarring is most painful. Send this dog to the church!” 
The poor man is dragged away, and the king retires with his councillors to discuss other business.  You take the opportunity to slip away from the hall.
“A rather harsh punishment, ritual scarring,” you mutter to Ti’quon as you exit the building.
“True enough,” admits Ti’quon. “Except that I noticed the poor man had already been scarred by the priests, and it is forbidden to perform the ritual twice. Getting him out of the sight of the mad king seemed to be the most important thing.”	You shake your head, smiling.  	<i>Record the code A34 </i>and turn to <b>19</b>.

You carefully begin to sneak out of the chamber, but you are out of luck.  The orcs spot you as you attempt to climb the stairs, and leap to a savage attack.

You are in a dreadful city of poor mud-brick and grass hovels, surrounded by weed-filled cropland. Even the most impressive buildings are little more than timber halls, sagging under the weight of their own roofs.  The local peasants are care-worn and well whipped, scarcely better dressed than slaves.  The wealthier members of the town dress less well than a Saltdad commoner.  The dissonant bells of the church of Cursus clang across town, followed by dirge-like processions of rag-wearing choristers singing hymns of dull praise to their uncaring deity.
  The whole rotten town is perched atop a cliff some fifty or so feet tall, and yet this is a port city.  A gigantic cargo crane leers over a thin and precarious path to the wooden harbour below, where at least some signs of life and love can be heard from the cluster of taverns that serve the sailors.

The passageway opens up into a long hall, lined with stamped bronze plates.  Torches burn in brackets along the walls, illuminating hideous murals of serpents devouring animals, trees and rocks.  You see daylight ahead and come upon a chamber whose roof is open to the blazing sun.  It is another temple chamber with black altars and fine silverwork dominating the room.
Rising from his position in front of the high altar, a snakeman priest in flowing vestal robes turns to gaze at you with piercing eyes.
“The heretic slaves return!” he hisses.  “Do not think that you can seek repentance from the lord of judgement now!  Once a traitor, always a traitor!”	If you have the code A41, turn to <b>714</b>.  If not, read on.
“We have betrayed no one!” you reply.  “You have trapped us here.  Allow us to leave and we will do you no harm.”	“Liars!  You have stolen our god!” spits the snakeman priest.  “Our breed faulters and dies.  Now, you shall die with us!”  The snakeman hisses foul words of sorcery.  Suddenly the temple walls begin to crack, and blocks of stone rain down upon you.  Even as the temple collapses the snakeman priest advances towards you, brandishing his staff.

Avoiding Chellar’s room, you still manage to secure a 
pretty horde of items. You may take any or all of the 
following:  <b>jewellery box</b>, <b>calligraphy ink</b>, <b>silver idol</b>, 
<b>gold portrait</b>, <b>bronze scorpion</b>. You emerge with 
Brekken back onto the landing.  You decide, with a

You have entered a chamber which is well furnished with 
flags and banners.  It has the feel of a Chalice temple, 
although there is no sign that anyone actually worships

of the room.  There are two exits from the chamber, 
each of them leading to a tunnel with stairs ascending.

You stand in the shadow of the Stonewalls, the finger-like crags soaring high into the burning sky.  Cut into the roots of a tall mountain are the infamous salt mines of Saltdad.  Dozens of warehouses are scattered around the entrance of the mine, with workers boiling away the salt from rock with water drawn from the Cold River to the east.  Below your feet, and deep into the mountain, you know that thousands of slaves toil in the grim darkness.
The mine guards bring you to the owners, hard-faced men with unflinching stares.	If you have the code A1, turn to<b> 532</b>.  If not, read on.
“I suppose you are here about the troglodytes,” sighs Clavod, the mine master.  “We are losing so many slaves it starts to become worth protecting them after a while. The deal is 25 silver for each troglodyte head you bring me.  Take it or leave it.”	Clavod sees your blank expression.  “Unless you came to arrange salt transportation, of course,” he says hastily.  “We can transport salt to ships moored in Clifftop or Cursus.”	Accept the mission to hunt the troglodytes (turn to <b>681</b>)?

The Everchild presents you with a bar of <b>gold bullion</b> to help convince the mercenaries to change sides.  Ayleta has been in private communication with the mercenaries for some time and has already negotiated a safe path between the mercenary encampment and the Everchild’s forces.
You are received coolly by the unit captain, who cautiously welcomes you into his tent with his officers and bodyguards around him.  You state your opinion that the Everchild’s victory in the coming conflict is all but certain, and that she is willing to let mercenary companies that co-operate with her depart safely. Matters soon turn to money, with the mercenary captain suggesting that quite a lot of additional money will be coming his way should the patriarch win the battle, and Saltdad and other cities need to be supressed.  He is also worried about his reputation if he plays turncoat without fighting even a single battle for his employer.  Only party members assigned to the mercenary team may assist with this skill check.

The harbour of Cursus is long and shallow.  The jetties reach far out beyond the coast, each wide enough for a pair of dragonyaks to drag the cargoes of ships to the warehouses on the beach.
You may buy a ship here, if you have enough money. The largest vessel for sale is the Cursite war galley, a coastal-hugging warship which carries little cargo, but is the only vessel that can even hope to compete with the more advanced vessels of Royce and Drakehallow.

With a dramatic flourish you unroll the <b>dragon head</b> from its wrappings (cross off the <b>dragon head</b> from your adventure sheet).  King Scarrenden stands in amazement, and a gasp echoes across the chamber.  His councillors flock round the head, to confirm its origins.
“This is indeed impressive,” agrees the king.  “I set you a challenge and you have overcome it.  Therefore, I shall be as good as my word.  I shall send the Everchild my finest berserkers to aid her struggle.  She also has the loyalty of my city.  May she be victorious in her endeavours, and may her glory be ours!”
There is a mixed cheer from the hall.  Not all are pleased that King Scarrenden has submitted his city to the rule of a child.  However, even here the Everchild’s fame is evident, and the enthusiasm of some of the warriors cannot be mistaken.
Add the following soldiers to the Luutanesh barracks. If the queen currently resides in Saltdad, add the soldiers to the Saltdad barracks instead.  These berserkers are strong but flighty troops, who will fight for you as long as the going is good.<b>Lhasbreath Berserkers</b> – Strength 5, Morale 2

Dazzling sunlight almost blinds you as you emerge into daylight.  You are in a sandy, secluded alleyway, the sounds of marketplace hawkers reaching your ears. You quickly help the Everchild out of the drains, hiding her behind some tall baskets as you check for the guards.
“We are free!” she gasps.  “I feared I might die in that terrible place.”
“What will you do now?” you ask.  “You cannot stay in the city…”
“No – here we shall divide for safety,” she agrees. “Che Long can look after me from here on in.  I cannot thank you enough for your safe delivery of myself and my followers.  I can give you no reward, and you owe me nothing, but…”
You silence her as you duck behind the baskets.  A guard patrol of men in gleaming bronze armour clank past, wickedly shaped halberds in their grasp.  “The Bronzeguard,” hisses Che Long.  “The elite warriors and boot lickers of the Iron King.  Their armour is supposedly enchanted, dug up from the palace vaults by the Iron King’s servants.”	“They are still men underneath,” you growl.
“If you hate tyranny and would see justice restored, come and find me in the Cold River Inn, in Luutanesh,” implores the Everchild.  “The path to freedom is long and difficult, but together we can find a way to end the bloody reign of the Iron King forever.”
The coast is clear, and Che Long quickly bows to you.  “We must go before the general alarm is raised. You have my thanks.  Come majesty.”

You return to the small reading room, mouldering books scattered across the tiny library.  If you currently own a <b>scroll of rage</b> you find nothing.  If you do not have this scroll, you are surprised to see it back on the shelf, in the same place you found it last time.  It seems that the scroll teleports back here each time it is used.  
You can take the <b>scroll of rage</b>, as long as you did not enter the room with one in your inventory.  You cannot have more than one <b>scroll of rage</b> equipped at any given time.  You can use it in combat to increase the Fighting score of each of your party members by 1 point until the end of the combat.  After one use it will teleport back to the bookshelf in this room.

Janus is overjoyed to see the locket.  You hand it over to him and he cradles it in his hands (cross the <b>bronze </b><b>locket</b> off your adventure sheet).  “Now I can remember Alidale always!” he sighs.  He opens the locket to have a look inside, when suddenly there is a flash and a profusion of smoke.
Stepping out of the smoke comes a young woman, a wizard by the looks of her, coughing and waving the smoke away from her face.  “Alidale?” gasps Janus.  “Why!  You don’t look a day older than when you left for that temple!”
“Janus!” she cries overjoyed.  “You... do look a bit older, if I’m honest.  I must have been in that locket for a long time.”
Alidale explains that she was surrounded by hideous serpent men and was forced to transport herself inside her locket for protection.  The snake men assumed she had teleported away, but in fact she has been trapped in the locket for all these years.  She never expected a rescue would take forty summers.  She has little to reward you with but shares with you some of her many discoveries and insights into the ancient world that she has uncovered in her travels.

Tackling the room will come in two stages.  Firstly, you must attempt to figure out the safest route.

Secondly, someone must attempt to carefully sneak through the room.

Timing it just right, you begin to shove one another in the water queue.

You gather round and attempt to pull apart the barrier, but despite its crude appearance it is actually very well built.  Even sledgehammers and mules couldn’t pull this barricade down from this side.  Is this as far as the orcs have penetrated into the complex?

The enemy are too numerous.  Horns are sounded, and your forces begin a general retreat.  Fortunately, you have the open desert to scatter into and a rearward base to reform at, but casualties are almost inevitable.  Roll a die for each unit you committed to this battle.  On a 1 or a 2 that unit has been destroyed.  The rest of your units manage to reform and retreat back to Saltdad.  Restore the Morale scores of each of your surviving units back to their starting value.

Your return trip to Lhasbreath is mercifully uneventful, and Sir Lawrence Ross lays on a grand banquet upon your arrival.  You spend several days with the Ross’s, recovering your strength and discussing your adventures.  Restore all your party members to maximum Health.
When Emlyn reports her findings, the news is good. “There are several herbs that appear to have medicinal qualities,” she smiles.  “Additionally, one of the flowers is producing a sweet pepper which seems edible and delicious.  If we can find a source of these in the wild, House Ross can enter the spice market.”
Sir Lawrence is overjoyed with these results. You receive <b>600 silver coins</b> as a reward.  In addition, he presents you with a <b>seal of House Ross</b>.  “Should you ever travel to Strongstone, present this to the castle steward, Wyrran Glenpetre.  You will be treated as an honoured guest.”
This has been an amazing adventure.  Choose a party member and increase their Survival skill by 1 point.

You manage to translate the brightly painted calendar, to the delight of Kopu.  He is impressed with your work and presents you with a <b>bluestone</b> as a reward.  You ask what the stone is for.
“It is sacred to our priesthood,” says Kopu.  “You can exchange it for blessings at our temples.”
“I thought you said Kalu had no temples anymore?” you press.	“Well,” he says.  “It’s the thought that counts.”

Your ship is boarded!  Dozens of the Bando swamp the decks, their poisoned blow darts and spears making short work of any opposition.  Surrounded, and realising the futility of your position, you surrender.
You are stripped and bound, along with the rest of your surviving crew.  Cross off all items of equipment carried by your party members, including any silver coins.  Your ship is looted and then sunk, cross it off your adventure sheet.
After spending a few days with the Bando in cramped bamboo cages, the mercenary tribesmen sell you off to a passing slaver ship in return for a few gemstones and some curious-looking fabrics.

There are a number of close shaves, and even minor impacts, but the raft holds steady as you correct its course through the sloping rapids.  Eventually the waters calm, and you ride the current downstream at a good speed. Looking at the densely packed jungle on either side you are glad to your soul that you didn’t have to hack your way through all that vegetation.  Eventually the jungle clears somewhat, and a wide, muddy bank comes into view.  Emlyn thinks you have gone far enough, and you beach the raft onto the bank.
“Skilfully done,” smiles Emlyn as you help her and the other scholars to shore.  “Let’s explore the unknown, shall we?”  Turn to <b>763.</b>

As you are pouring the poison into the cauldron, the head chef catches your hand.  “What’s that?” she demands sharply.  You drop the vial (cross the <b>vial of poison</b> off your sheet) and bolt away, even as the chefs yell for the guards.  You make a dash for the walls, hoping to be able to leap over the low barricades of the compound and into freedom.  You make it to one of the squat towers that line the walls, but alas, three Bronzeguard soldiers stand alert in the room.  Barricading the door behind you, the team grimly draw their weapons and prepare to fight!

That night, you stroll along the terrace, the sky a canopy of stars, reflected in the watery rice paddies that surround the house.  You need some fresh air.  Being treated as a hero all day and night can be exhausting.
You spy Brash leaning back on a chair, his feet up on the railings, a cup of rice wine in hand.  He stares out over the still landscape.
“Silver for your thoughts,” you say, causing Brash to yelp in surprise, fall off his chair and crash to ground.
“Ah!  Akihiro!  Always catching me at my best!” Brash says sheepishly.  You offer him a hand up, the fair lad accepting, pulled almost into an embrace.  He blushes and backs away.
“Not like you to lose your tongue, my friend,” you smile.  “You’ve been avoiding me, I sense.”
“A bit,” he says.  “I just don’t know what to do with myself these days…”
“How so?” you ask.  When he doesn’t respond you flick him a silver coin, which he catches with his quick reflexes.  He looks at it in his hand and realises he has been fooled.
“I’ve been thinking about you,” he admits.  “Quite a bit.  I don’t know what to do about it.  The kind of feelings I have aren’t allowed in Royce.”
“They are not allowed anywhere,” you say, joining him at the railings.  “There are many men who would rather kill than love.  And more who would kill to stop love, no matter how earnest.  I will never hurry you, Brash, but I do not accept uncertainty.  If you feel for me what I feel for you, you must be sure.  Once done, we cannot undo it.”
You are disturbed by a creak on the floorboards.  You turn to see your sister arriving on the terrace.  “Come, Akihiro, you are asked for!  Do not keep the people from their hero!”
“The price of fame,” you smile.  “Come, Brash.  Walking out on a party is not done.”
You offer him your hand, and he accepts, squeezing before releasing.  Note in Akihiro’s notes box that he has gained a heart for Brash.  Brash also gains a heart for Akihiro.  <i>Gain the code A98</i>.  Now turn to <b>450</b>.
